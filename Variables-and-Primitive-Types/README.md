# Variables and Primitive Types in JavaScript
## Introduction
In **JavaScript**, variables are used to store data values, which can have different types. Primitive types are the basic building blocks of JavaScript. This readme file will guide you through the concept of variables and primitive types in JavaScript.

## Variables
Variables in JavaScript are declared with the ‘var’, ‘let’, or ‘const’ keywords followed by the variable name. Here’s an example:
```
var message = "Hello, world!";
let count = 5;
const pi = 3.14;
```
In the above example, message, count, and pi are variable names, and they are assigned values of different types.
## Primitive Types
In JavaScript, there are five primitive types: Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, and Null. Let’s discuss each of them in detail.
## Number
The Number primitive type represents numeric values. It can be used for integers, floats, and even special numeric values like Infinity and NaN (Not-a-Number). Here’s an example:

```
var age = 25;
var pi = 3.14159;
```
## String
The String primitive type represents textual data. It is enclosed in either single quotes ('') or double quotes (""). Here's an example:

```
var name = "John Doe";
var message = 'Hello, world!';
```
## Boolean
The Boolean primitive type represents either true or false values. It is useful for making decisions and controlling the flow of programs using conditional statements. Here's an example:

```
var isLogged = true;
var hasPermission = false;
```
## Undefined
The Undefined primitive type represents a variable declared but not assigned a value. Here’s an example:
```
var x; // undefined
```

## Null
The Null primitive type represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to indicate the intentional absence of an object value. Here’s an example:
```
var person = null;
```
## Conclusion
Understanding variables and primitive types is essential in JavaScript programming. Variables store different types of data values, and primitive types represent the basic building blocks of JavaScript. Use the provided examples and explanations as a starting point to dive deeper into JavaScript programming.
